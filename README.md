Team RSVP Manager – Coding Challenge
This module is part of the Gametime Hero Coding Challenge — a clean and testable RSVP management service designed for modern, scalable apps.

# Features

- Add or update a player’s RSVP
- View a list of confirmed attendees
- Get counts of total, confirmed, and declined responses

# Supported RSVP statuses:

"Yes"
"No"
"Maybe"

## Run Command:

Step 1: Install dependencies
npm install

Step 2: Run the application (will start the development server)
npm run dev

# Tech Stack

- Vite – fast and modern build tool
- TypeScript – for strong typing
- React – component-based UI (if extended to a frontend)
- Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling framework

# Future Improvements

- Support for event-specific RSVPs
- Integration with calendar systems
- UI layer or API endpoints (REST/GraphQL)
